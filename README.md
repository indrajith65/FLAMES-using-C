# FLAMES Game in C
The "FLAMES" game is a popular pastime often used to predict the potential romantic compatibility or relationship between two individuals' names. The name "FLAMES" is an acronym representing different stages of a relationship: Friend, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enemy, and Sister.


## How the Game Works

- Take two names as input.
- Eliminate common letters from both names.
- Count the remaining letters.
- Use the FLAMES acronym (Friendship, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enmity, Sister) to determine the relationship outcome.
- After cancelling each letter based on the count, the last remaining letter's acronym will be considered as relationship type.

## Example
Enter the first name: John  
Enter the second name: Mary  
Result: AFFECTIONATE
